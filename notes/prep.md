## List
  * Find n-th from last, slow & fast two pointers,
  * Detect cycle, if fast & slow pointers can meet.
  * Merge multiple sorted, using heap,

## Stack
  * Validate parenthesis,
  * Next bigger number in O(n),

## Tree
  * DFS, biggest node, path sum
  * BFS, shortest path in binary matrix, print binary tree on levels,
  
## Graph
  * DFS/backtrack, if word exist in graph,
  * BFS, min distance between to nodes,
  * Backtrack, permutation, subset, maze, etc,
  
## Dynamic Programming
  * prev state -> current state -> next state,
